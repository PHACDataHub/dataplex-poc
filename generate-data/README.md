# Sample Synthetic Data

The focus here is to generate data to demonstrate Dataplex's functionality. While we're using the surveillance programs names, the data generated is based on over-simplfied, non-epidemiological guestimates - please treat these more as placeholders.  

## Branches and Surveillance Programs

### NML 
* covid 19 wastewater

### Vaccine Roll-out Task force
* seasonal influenza vaccination coverage
* survey of vaccination during pregnancy 

### Infectious Diseases Program Branch (with NML)
* Flu watch / Flu watchers

### Infectious Diseases Program Branch
* Lyme disease
* Tuberculosis

### Health promotion and chronic disease prevention branch 
* Cancer in young people

### Strategic policy branch 
* Health Inequalities Reporting inititive

Note - this has been re-worked to have one survellance activity per GCP project as Dataplex is active on the global plane. 

* Activate venv and run p1 -> p4 files to create fake data, populate buckets and attach data assets to zones. 

```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
